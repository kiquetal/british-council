### Class


Student B First read the situation and think about what you would say to maintain good relations and resolve the situation. Then role-play the situation together. 

1 - You arranged with your friend to meet at 9.30 outside the cinema. It’s 7 o’clock now and you are at yoga/football practice. Your friend phones. Try to resolve the situation. 

2 - It’s your birthday today. You asked everyone to arrive for a late lunch at 2.30. You are having a shower and your mobile phone rings. 

3 - You lost your mobile phone recently but your sister now confesses she ‘borrowed’ it. You have lots of messages from your friend about dinner this weekend. 

4 - You are hosting a birthday party. Everyone brings presents although you told them not to, except one friend who is looking really embarrassed.
