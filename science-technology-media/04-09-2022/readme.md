### Exercises

Scientific research involves scientists 
carrying out
 research to 
test a hypothesis
 or to prove a theory. Of course, much scientific research involves scientists performing 
experiments
 which are inconclusive and not all research brings about a 
scientific breakthrough
. However, from time to time experiments are successful. The results are recorded and the 
findings published
 in scientific journals. If the research is conducted in an effort to produce a new pharmaceutical treatment, then this could lead to 
clinical trials
, but only after rigorous testing. The results of an experiment may have no immediate 
impact
, but research is like a large jigsaw puzzle and scientists often need to wait many years to witness the 
advances made
 as a result of their work
